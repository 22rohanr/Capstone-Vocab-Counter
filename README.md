# Capstone-Vocab-Counter

## Features ##
This program will print the total vocab word count and a brief unit-by-unit analysis for your capstone essay. All you have to do is input the essay's word count and then the essay itself. 

## Usage ##
Clone the repository or download the project as a .zip file. Then, open the files in an IDE. Now, run the main method in the WordCounter.java file. Alternatively, you can create a class called "WordCounter" in an IDE and copy and paste the code from the WordCounter.java file in this project into your class. Then you, need to make a text file called "vocabWords" and copy and paste the text from the vocabWords file in this project into your text file. To use the program, you only need to run the main method.

## Notes ##
If your essay uses a word such as "dungeon" that is very similar to the vocab word "dun" this program may mistakenly count it as a vocab word. Just make sure to double check the unit-by-unit analysis since it lists out all of the words in your essay that were counted as vocab words. Also, in case you are wondering, I omitted the last letters of some words in the vocabWords text file to account for changes in tense (ex: assuages, assuaging, assuaged).
