# Capstone-Vocab-Counter
This program will print the total vocab word count and a brief unit-by-unit analysis for your capstone essay. All you have to do is input the essay's word count and then the essay itself. Note that if your essay uses a word such as "dungeon" that is very similar to the vocab word "dun" this program may mistakenly count it as a vocab word. Just make sure to double check the unit-by-unit analysis since it lists out all of the words in your essay that were counted as vocab words. Also note that I omitted the last letters of some words in the vocabWords files to account for changes in tense (ex: assuages, assuaging, assuaged).
